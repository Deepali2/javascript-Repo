/*
Problem Statement:
We have two strings A and B with the same super set of characters. We need to change these strings to obtain two equal strings. In each move we can perform one of the following operations:

1. swap two consecutive characters of a string  
2. swap the first and the last characters of a string
A move can be performed on either string.
What is the minimum number of moves that we need in order to obtain two equal strings?
